# simpleangular
Please develop a simple web chat.
1. Before entering the chat, the user is prompted to enter his name, which
is further used to identify his messages.
2. Implement saving messages in memory (on the local machine, in
localstorage or somewhere else, without a backend).
3. Each new browser tab is a new chat user. Each new browser tab is a
new chat user. The new messages in the chat room should be updated
to all opened tabs (live updating for all users). Not use socket.io all.
4. Implement functionality for sending messages to chat.
5. Implement functionality for show message history, and load more
messages when scroll chats to the top. (page size = 25)
6. Please write tests on features where they are needed for you think.
